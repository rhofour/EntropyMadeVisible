		<H1>Probability Review</H1>
		In probability the <b>event space</b> is said the be the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment we are concerned with. In the case of this tool we are observing two nuerons spike counts which vary from 0 to n based on some stimulus. <br>
		The <b>probability</b> of some event occuring can be defined as the number of times this event event can be seen in your event space. 
		$$P(E)= \frac{\text{number of times we observe E}}{\text{number of events in our event space}}$$
		The <b>joint probability</b> of two events is then simply defined as the probability of these two events occuring simultaneously. In the case of our diagram it is simply the probability in cell \( (i,j)\) where the events are \( X = i\) and \( Y = j\) . <br>
		We now review <b>conditional probability</b>. In probability theory conditional probability measures the probability of an event given that another event has occured. In the examples given in this assignment the events we will be casing on will be the number of spikes of the other neuron. In mathematics you can write this as
		$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \bigcap B)}{P(B)}$$
		This now gives us a link between condtional probability, conditional probability, and normal probability!
		<H1>Problem 1</H1>
		Given the following diagram representing the spike counts of two neurons(X and Y) determine the following probabilities
		$$P(X = 1)$$
		$$P(X = 2)$$
		$$P(Y = 1)$$
		$$P(Y = 2)$$
